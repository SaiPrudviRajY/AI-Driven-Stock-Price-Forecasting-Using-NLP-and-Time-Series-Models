# Leveraging-Deep-Learning-and-NLP-for-Stock-Market-Forecasting
This project explores whether combining historical stock data with financial news sentiment can improve stock price predictions. Most forecasting models focus only on past trends, but this project looks at how market sentiment captured from news might impact predictions.

The analysis focuses on 10 stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Eli Lilly (LLY), Broadcom (AVGO), Tesla (TSLA), and Walmart (WMT)
